# Full Stack App with React and a REST API
 #unit10

The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.</br>
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
