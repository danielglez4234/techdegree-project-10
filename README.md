# Full Stack App with React and a REST API
 #unit10

The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.</br>
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

- In one of the terminals go to the **/api** folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Second, seed the **SQLite database**, run `npm run seed`, when finished run `npm start`.
- In the **_second terminal_** go to the **/client** folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies, when finished run `npm start`.
- and that's it, the project will open in the browser.
